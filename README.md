**Tech Stack(s) We Plan to Use:**
We will be using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.

**What Our App Will Do for the User:**
For our project we will be creating a platform for prospective and current UCSB students to meet roommates living on-campus, in IV, or in the greater Santa Barbara area. As stated above we will be using React and Firebase to create our application. Users will login using their UCSB email addresses, which will be implemented using Google OAuth. React provides the frontend framework for building user interfaces, while Firebase provides the backend services such as real-time database, authentication, and hosting. We are using Firebase as the backend for a React so that users' data can be easily synced and updated in real-time, providing a seamless user experience.

**User Roles:**
- UCSB students looking for housing: allowed to create profile, update personal information, post listing looking for roommates, rate/review leasing companies and dorms
- Representatives for leasing companies: post housing listings once approved
- Administrators (us): delete inappropriate/spam profiles/posts, add new data, make updates to application's functions

**Installation:**
- Deploy Web App: https://t08-buddy-up.web.app/
- See team/MVP_DEMO.md for MVP demo video

**Prerequisites**
*TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which version(s) of your framework(s) of choice)*

**Dependencies**
*TODO: List which libraries / add-ons you added to the project, and the purpose each of those add-ons serves in your app.*

**Installation Steps**
*TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch). Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with act, you can run GitHub Actions locally).*

**Functionality**
*TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section, and showcase your features.*

**Known Problems**
*TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.*

**Contributing**
*No outside contribution at this time*
