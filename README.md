**Tech Stack(s) We Plan to Use:**
We will be using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.

**What Our App Will Do for the User:**
For our project we will be creating a platform for prospective and current UCSB students to meet roommates living on-campus, in IV, or in the greater Santa Barbara area. As stated above we will be using React and Firebase to create our application. Users will login using their UCSB email addresses, which will be implemented using Google OAuth. React provides the frontend framework for building user interfaces, while Firebase provides the backend services such as real-time database, authentication, and hosting. We are using Firebase as the backend for a React so that users' data can be easily synced and updated in real-time, providing a seamless user experience.

**User Roles:**
- UCSB students looking for housing: allowed to create profile, update personal information, post listing looking for roommates, rate/review leasing companies and dorms
- Representatives for leasing companies: post housing listings once approved
- Administrators (us): delete inappropriate/spam profiles/posts, add new data, make updates to application's functions
