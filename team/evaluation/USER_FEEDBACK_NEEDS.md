*document three things about your product that you would love to have user feedback on (just to give example possibilities: user preference between two designs, an A/B study on the consequences of two designs, user satisfaction with a particular feature, user satisfaction with your overall current product, but there are many more possibilities)*
1. User satisfaction with the post fields and tag options (housing pref,location, etc.)
2. User preference between having separate buttons for information on campus vs off-campus housing or just having all the information on one page
3. Overall opinion on design choices of our application (color/style, location/accessibility of buttons)
