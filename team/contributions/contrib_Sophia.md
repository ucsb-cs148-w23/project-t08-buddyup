I worked with Lauren and Brenna to create the login (including Google OAuth and UCSB login only), sidebar (which contains a user's name, profile photo, housing information buttons, and sign out button), and comments (which consists of the ability to comment, a button which allows a user to view comments under a post, and a display of the number of comments on a post) components. I made UI changes, including decisions on fonts, colors, and formatting for the login page, dashboard, profiles, and housing information pages).
