I mainly worked with Sophia and Lauren in a programming group. Together the three of us implemented the functionality of comments on posts, sidebar, login page, and UI style decisions, such as fonts, colors, formatting, etc. The three of us also merged a lot of the website together to cohesively work. I worked with other teammates to fix smaller bugs, especially when related to the UI design and Chakra UI.
