I personally managed a good amount of the administrative portion of this class for my group. For example this meant ensuring that all the files and documents were made/edited for the weekly labs. I worked with Sophia and Lauren in a programming group. Together the three of us implemented the comments on posts, sidebar, login page, UI style decisions, and merged a lot of the website together to cohesively work.

I attended lectures, discussion sections, and most of the group meetings, and communicated often through the team's Discord to ensure that everyone was aware of group deadlines and assignments. I also updated the Kanban Board regularly, making sure each person always had an in progress issue w/ acceptance criteria.
