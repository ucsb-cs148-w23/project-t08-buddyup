*finalize brief commentary on team member code (and/or other) contributions in team/contributions/CONTRIBS.md: each team member should initially write their own section.*


**Anouki's Contribution:**

**Sophia's Contribution:**

**Lauren's Contribution:**

**Sergio's Contribution:**

**Kai's Contribution:**
The main areas I worked on were user profiles, profile editting, and post filters. I also helped out fixing small bugs and adding small features all over the app. I made a few passes over the code to remove any unused imports, variables, and console.log's that were giving us errors. I have a lot of pull requests because I tried to keep each issue I worked on in a separate pull request. My coding partner was Sergio, and we worked together on the profiles and post filters. We worked together by splitting the work, then working together to fix any blockers we were having.

**Brenna's Contribution:**

**Contributor's Graph Explanation**
Our graph is not completely accurate because we utilized pair/group programming throughout the course of the quarter. For the most part Anouki and Kaiwen worked together, Kai and Sergio worked together, and Sophia/Brenna/Lauren worked together. This is the reason why Brenna, Kai, and Kaiwen are the top contributors to commit because they more often committed and merged their group branches to main. Brenna also led the UI branch, but worked alongside the whole group, and just ended up being the person that merged everything after working on it. For example Kaiwen and Anouki worked on implementing the informational pages in ktapInfo2, but Brenna edited their branch to merge with her changes and eventually pushed that branch to main. Brenna also has a disproportional number of commits because she was often the scribe and edited alot of the group pages in the github repo, the stuff not related to coding. All in all the amount of coding was pretty equal amongst the subgroups of pair/group programming.
