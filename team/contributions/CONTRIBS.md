*finalize brief commentary on team member code (and/or other) contributions in team/contributions/CONTRIBS.md: each team member should initially write their own section.*


**Anouki's Contribution:**
I worked on creating the dashboard page for the MVP, which included creating the post text boxes, the post button, and the inital posting functionality of the dashboard page. In addition to this, I also created post fields that were more applicable to our website specifically (On/Off-campus housing). I was also responsible for creating the housing informational pages that are linked on the sidebar. 

My coding partner was Kaiwen, and we worked together on all of these elements. At times, I helped my team members in any obstacles they were having with their assigned issues if needed. 

**Sophia's Contribution:**
I worked with Lauren and Brenna to create the login, sidebar, and comments components. I also made UI decisions (fonts, colors, formatting).

**Lauren's Contribution:**
First, I implemented the GoogleOAuth Sign-in and Sign-out functionality. Within this, I also set up the structure so that those who are not logged in do not have access to any of the protected pages and are kicked back out to the log-in page if they try to put in the URL. Then, for the majority of the time I worked with Sophia and Brenna to add a comment section to the posts, add a comment button to the posts where users can click to view the comments, display the number of comments on the post next to this comment button, create the sidebar that contains the currently logged-in user's name and photo and buttons to sign out and view the housing information pages, and implement functionality so that it only allows people to log in with a UCSB email. I also helped out with various other issues/bugs as they arose.

**Sergio's Contribution:**
My main contributions in the beginning were with setting up the code for a nearly blank webpage and connecting it to both the Firestore Database and the Firebase Hosting. After that I mainly worked on code involving users and their profiles, such as creating users and their profile pages. I also worked on the post filtering mechanic and autodeployment of our webapp through github actions. Aside from that, I did also work on some more techincal debugging of our code when there were issues with installing dependencies, the app not deploying properly, and new users not being able to load the app on first log-in.

My coding partner was Kai, and we worked on a lot of the profile stuff together. We mainly split the work and worked separately, but we would help each other whenever we were stuck on something or if we wanted to discuss implementation details.

**Kai's Contribution:**
The main areas I worked on were user profiles, profile editting, and post filters. I also helped out fixing small bugs and adding small features all over the app. I made a few passes over the code to remove any unused imports, variables, and console.log's that were giving us errors. I have a lot of pull requests because I tried to keep each issue I worked on in a separate pull request. My coding partner was Sergio, and we worked together on the profiles and post filters. We worked together by splitting the work, then working together to fix any blockers we were having.

**Brenna's Contribution:**
I mainly worked with Sophia and Lauren in a programming group. Together the three of us implemented the functionality of adding comments on posts, displaying sidebar with login/housing/profile buttons, login page with Google OAuth login ability for UCSB students, and UI style decisions, such as fonts, colors, formatting, etc. I helped to format and style the informational housing pages, once Kaiwen and Anouki created the page and added the text. I also with the team to merge a lot of the website together in order for it to cohesively function. I worked with other teammates to fix smaller bugs, especially when related to the UI design and Chakra UI.

**Kaiwen's Contribution:**
My partner when working was Anouki, so we basically worked with pair programming throughout this entire project. I worked on the main dashboard page for the MVP, which involved initial post functionality, post button, and post text boxes. I also worked on post fields that specified the on campus/off campus details of the post. I also worked on the housing informational pages on the right sidebar. I narrated and presented the demo for both the MVP and final presentation. I also helped my team members in any obstacles they were having with their assigned issues if needed.

**Contributor's Graph Explanation**
Our graph is not completely accurate because we utilized pair/group programming throughout the course of the quarter. For the most part Anouki and Kaiwen worked together, Kai and Sergio worked together, and Sophia/Brenna/Lauren worked together. This is the reason why Brenna, Kai, and Kaiwen are the top contributors to commit because they more often committed and merged their group branches to main. Brenna also led the UI branch, but worked alongside the whole group, and just ended up being the person that merged everything after working on it. For example Kaiwen and Anouki worked on implementing the informational pages in ktapInfo2, but Brenna edited their branch to merge with her changes and eventually pushed that branch to main. Brenna also has a disproportional number of commits because she was often the scribe and edited alot of the group pages in the github repo, the stuff not related to coding. All in all the amount of coding was pretty equal amongst the subgroups of pair/group programming.
