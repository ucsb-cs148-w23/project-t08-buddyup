I worked on creating the dashboard page for the MVP, which included creating the post text boxes, the post button, and the inital posting functionality of the dashboard page. In addition to this, I also created post fields that were more applicable to our website specifically (On/Off-campus housing). I was also responsible for creating the housing informational pages that are linked on the sidebar. 

My coding partner was Kaiwen, and we worked together on all of these elements. At times, I helped my team members in any obstacles they were having with their assigned issues if needed.
