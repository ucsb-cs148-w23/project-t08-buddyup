The main areas I worked on were user profiles, profile editting, and post filters. I also helped out fixing small bugs and adding small features all over the app. I made a few passes over the code to remove any unused imports, variables, and console.log's that were giving us errors. I have a lot of pull requests because I tried to keep each issue I worked on in a separate pull request.
My coding partner was Sergio, and we worked together on the profiles and post filters. We worked together by splitting the work, then working together to fix any blockers we were having.
