First, I implemented the GoogleOAuth Sign-in and Sign-out functionality. Within this, I also set up the structure so that those who are not logged in do not have access to any of the protected pages and are kicked back out to the log-in page if they try to put in the URL.
Then, for the majority of the time I worked with Sophia and Brenna to add a comment section to the posts, add a comment button to the posts where users can click to view the comments, display the number of comments on the post next to this comment button, create the sidebar that contains the currently logged-in user's name and photo and buttons to sign out and view the housing information pages, and implement functionality so that it only allows people to log in with a UCSB email.
I also helped out with various other issues/bugs as they arose.
