## Contributions: Sergio Colis Chavez

My main contributions in the beginning were with setting up the code for a nearly blank webpage and connecting it to both the Firestore Database and the Firebase Hosting.  After that I mainly worked on code involving users and their profiles, such as creating users and their profile pages.  I also worked on the post filtering mechanic and autodeployment of our webapp through github actions.  Aside from that, I did also work on some more techincal debugging of our code when there were issues with installing dependencies, the app not deploying properly, and new users not being able to load the app on first log-in. 

My coding partner was Kai, and we worked on a lot of the profile stuff together. We mainly split the work and worked separately, but we would help each other whenever we were stuck on something or if we wanted to discuss implementation details.
