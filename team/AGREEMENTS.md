Group Agreements:

- If we miss a meeting we should do our best to catch up as quickly as possible
- Let the group and teaching team know when you are going to miss a meeting, as far in advance as possible
- Communicate as much as possible; keep group updated as you work on labs (in discord and slack channel)
- Attend class/meetings as much as possible
- Come to class/meetings prepared with appropriate tools
- We will each do our best to contribute to our team's project and work hard
- Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team member(s) what they missed and help them get back up to speed
- Team members will not discourage those who are less experienced and instead will offer advice and guidance
