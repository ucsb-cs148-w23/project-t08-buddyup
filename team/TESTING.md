**Lab 5 and 6 Tests**

**1) How you implemented the unit test requirement from the previous lab (which testing library, which part(s) of the code, etc.)**
We used the jest testing library to create our unit tests. Our code for the tests are located in the src folder, under the tests file. The lab 5 unit test, which is a render test, ensures that the app is able to start. This test is located in the Render_test.js file. 

**2) Your plans regarding unit tests going forward (it’s ok to not go all in with unit tests, but document and reason your decision.)**
Given the time constraint of this project it may be hard to implement unit tests. If we add our features and have extra time, we plan to add unit tests. Otherwise we will implement smaller checks for correct functionality of our web app.

**3) How you satisfied the component/integration/end-to-end testing requirement from this lab (which testing library, which part(s) of the code, etc.)** 
For the end-to-end test we created this week for lab 6, we made a test that checks...    This test is located in the same subfolder, but the code is in the ... file. 
 
**4) Plans regarding higher-level testing going forward (it’s again ok to not commit to an integrated testing solution, but document and reason your decision).**
Similar to our response above, since we are limited by time we are unsure we if we will be able to commit to an integrated testing solution. In the real world we would definitely add higher-level testing, but at this time we are focused more on adding features to our web app.
