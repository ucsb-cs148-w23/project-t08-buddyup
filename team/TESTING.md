**Lab 5 Test**
- Lab 5 unit test in Render_test.js file under tests folder in src folder
- Render test that ensures that the app is able to start


**Lab 5 and 6 Tests**

**1) How you implemented the unit test requirement from the previous lab (which testing library, which part(s) of the code, etc.)**


**2) Your plans regarding unit tests going forward (it’s ok to not go all in with unit tests, but document and reason your decision.)**


**3) How you satisfied the component/integration/end-to-end testing requirement from this lab (which testing library, which part(s) of the code, etc.)** 
 
 
**4) Plans regarding higher-level testing going forward (it’s again ok to not commit to an integrated testing solution, but document and reason your decision).**
