**Current level of familiarity with teamâ€™s chosen tech stack:**
- Brenna: no experience with either, besides using Firebase for helloworld application
- Sophia: zero experience, used React in CS 156 but used templated code so not very familiar
- Lauren: zero experience with either, besides using Firebase for helloworld application
- Sergio: zero experience with either
- Kai: zero experience with either
- Anouki: used Firebase once a few years ago, and used React in CS 156 but used templated code so not very familiar with either
- Kaiwen: zero experience with either
