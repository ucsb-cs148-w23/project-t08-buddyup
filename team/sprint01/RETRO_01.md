## Retro Assessment

- The retro outline we used was Start/Stop/Continue. We took three minutes initially to jot down what we thought was worth starting, stopping, and continuing. 
- I think that the retro went smoothly. Everyone had a few items for each category and we have a diverse pool of reflections to learn from. 
- Next time, give more time for brainstorming ideas to share. Three minutes might not have been enough time to calmly reflect and was a little rushed.
