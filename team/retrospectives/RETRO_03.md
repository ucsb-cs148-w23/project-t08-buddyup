## Retro Assessment
We used Start/Stop/Continue for our retro; each member of our group thought of actions we should start, stop, and continue doing. This retro went well -- the Start/Stop/Continue process is a good way to get teams to reflect on the work we've been doing in small groups and indivudally. For the next person leading a retro, I advise they ask each member to come up with more than 1 idea for each Start/Stop/Continue. This way, people are reflecting more deeply about the work they've been doing.
