## Retro Assessment

* We used the Start/Stop/Continue process where everyone came up with things to start doing, stop doing, and continue doing.
* Overall, the retrospective went pretty well and we were able to generate some good ideas for all the categories (start/stop/continue).
* It's helpful to have everyone start thinking about what they want to say a day or 2 in advance so their answers are more thought out and relevant.
